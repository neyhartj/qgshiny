# qgshiny

## Author

Jeff Neyhart

## Description

This is an R package that includes a Shiny Application for teaching introductory quantitative genetics through interactive simulations. This app was first designed for the HORT/AGRO 4401 course at the University of Minnesota, however it may be widely applicable.

## Installation

You may install the stable version of the package from CRAN by running:

```
install.packages("qgshiny")
```

Alternatively, you can install the developmental version from GitHub by using the `devtools` package:

```
devtools::install_github("neyhartj/qgshiny")
```

## Run the App

To run the Shiny App locally, load the `qgshiny` package and use the `run_example()` function:

```
library(qgshiny)

run_example()
```


<!-- ## Teaching Material -->

<!-- I have written a lab worksheet to accompany the shiny app. You may access the PDF [here](https://github.com/neyhartj/qgdemo/raw/master/teaching_materials/qgdemo_problem_set.pdf) and a copy of the intendend answer key [here](https://github.com/neyhartj/qgdemo/raw/master/teaching_materials/qgdemo_problem_set_answers.pdf). -->
